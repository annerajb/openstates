<h2>Project Status</h2>

<p> As of February 13th, 2012 we have data for 47 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. </p>

<p> States are denoted as either "ready" or "experimental" depending on how
reliable the source data is and how thoroughly we've vetted and cleaned up the
scraped data.  We do our best to provide high quality data for all states,
but you are more likely to find incomplete data where we haven't been able to
identify a source or done manual reconciliation of ids when using experimental
states.
</p>

<p>If you are curious about the specific status of state data check below
for any <a href="#state-specific">state specific issues</a>.</p>

<p>If you encounter issues using data from any state please let us know via the
<a href="https://github.com/sunlightlabs/openstates/issues">
Open State Project Issue Tracker</a> or mention it on
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/fifty-state-project">the Open States
google group</a>.</p>

<h4> Ready States </h4>
<p> Ready states (green on the above map) are states that are regarded as the highest quality, they have been stable for a long time and have gone through an additional QA procedure.
Currently this includes Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Idaho,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nevada, New Jersey,
North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington DC,

status.  Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico,
Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming fall in this category.

<a name="state-specific"><h3> State-specific Issues </h3></a>

<a name="CO"><h4>Colorado</h4></a>
<ul>
    <li>Colorado does not provide a reliable source for roll call votes but does have
    easily parsable committee votes. We'll continue to investigate options to provide
    Colorado's roll call votes in the future.
    </li>
</ul>

<a name="HI"><h4>Hawaii</h4></a>
<ul>
    <li>Hawaii does not provide a reliable source for roll call votes but does have
    easily parsable committee votes.  We provide all votes that are available
    via http://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/.</li>
</ul>

<a name="IN"><h4>Indiana</h4></a>
<ul>
    <li>Indiana only makes their votes available in scanned PDFs that currently
    prevent us from capturing legislator roll calls.</li>
</ul>

<a name="IA"><h4>Iowa</h4></a>
<ul>
    <li>Iowa does not provide roll call votes in a format that we can parse with
    any reliability, so at the moment we do not provide any roll call votes for
    Iowa.</li>
</ul>

<a name="KY"><h4>Kentucky</h4></a>
<ul>
    <li>Kentucky only makes their votes available in scanned PDFs that currently
    prevent us from capturing legislator roll calls.</li>
</ul>

<a name="MA"><h4>Massachusetts</h4></a>
<ul>
    <li>Massachusetts does not provide a source for individual roll call votes,
    unfortunately this means we are unable to provide this data as well.</li>
    <li>It should also be noted that districts in Mass. do not obey a typical
    alphanumeric format, and have somewhat unreliable names.  An attempt has
    been made to clean these up into a standard format but it is likely
    to be a source of some confusion when using their data.</li>
</ul>

<a name="MN"><h4>Minnesota</h4></a>
<ul>
    <li>Minnesota does not provide legislator roll calls for votes taken in the
    Senate so we are lacking detailed votes for the MN Senate.</li>
</ul>

<a name="NE"><h4>Nebraska</h4></a>
<ul>
    <li>Nebraska does not provide roll call votes in a format that we can parse with
    any reliability, so at the moment we do not provide any roll call votes for
    Nebraska.</li>
</ul>

<a name="ND"><h4>North Dakota</h4></a>
<ul>
    <li>North Dakota currently does not seem to provide detailed roll call votes so we are
    lacking this information.</li>
</ul>
