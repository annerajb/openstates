<h2>Committee API</h2>

{% rest %}

Two API methods are available for accessing committees:

`Committee Lookup`_
    Lookup current details/membership for a committee.
`Committee Search`_
    Allows looking up committees by (almost) any of their attributes.  (Doesn't return memberships.)

Both methods return committee objects with the following fields (in the case of search, a subset of these fields).

Committee Fields
================

Committee methods return objects with the following fields:

``id``
    Open States Committee ID.
``chamber``
    Associated chamber (``upper``, ``lower``, or ``joint``).
``state``
    State abbreviation (eg. ``ny``).
``committee``
    Name of committee.
``subcommittee``
    Name of subcommittee (null if record describes a top level
    committee).
``parent_id``
    For subcommittees, the committee ID of its parent. ``null`` otherwise.
``members``
    Listing of the current committee membership.

    ``legislator``
        Name of legislator (as captured from source).
    ``role``
        Role of this member on the committee (usually 'member' but may indicate
        charimanship or other special status)
    ``leg_id``
        Legislator's Open States ID
``sources``
    List of sources that this data was collected from.

    ``url``
        URL of the source

.. note::
   ``members`` and ``sources`` are not included in the committee search API results

.. note::
    Keep in mind that these documented fields may be a subset of the fields provided for a given state. (See `extra fields </api/#extra-fields>`_.)
