<h2>Legislator API</h2>

{% rest %}

Three API methods are available for accessing legislators:

`Legislator Lookup`_
    Get all available information for a legislator.
`Legislator Search`_
    Allows looking up legislators by (almost) any of their attributes.  (Doesn't return memberships.)
`Geo Lookup`_
    Search for all legislators that represent an area containing a location.

These methods return legislator objects with the following fields (or a subset in the case of search).

Legislator Fields
=================

All legislator methods return Legislator objects consisting of the following fields:

* ``leg_id``: A permanent, unique identifier for this legislator
  within the Open States system.
* ``full_name``
* ``first_name``
* ``last_name``
* ``middle_name``
* ``suffixes``
* ``url``
* ``email``
* ``photo_url``
* ``active`` - Boolean indicating whether or not this legislator is currently serving.
* ``state``, ``chamber``, ``district``, ``party`` (only present if the legislator is
  currently serving)
* ``roles``: A list of objects representing roles this legislator currently holds. Each role will contain at least the ``type`` and
  ``term`` roles:

  * ``type`` the type of role - e.g. "member", "committee member", "Lt. Governor"
  * ``term`` the term the role was held during
  * ``chamber``
  * ``district``
  * ``party``
  * ``committee``
  * ``term``
* ``old_roles``: A dictionary mapping term names for past terms to lists of roles held. (Sub-objects have same fields as ``roles``.)
* ``sources``
  List of sources that this data was collected from.

  * ``url``: URL of the source

.. note::
    ``sources``, ``roles`` and ``old_roles`` are not included in the legislator search response.

.. note::
    Keep in mind that these documented fields may be a subset of the fields provided for a given state. (See `extra fields </api/#extra-fields>`_.)
