<h2>Districts API</h2>

{% rest %}

Sometimes it is necessary to get a listing of all districts in a state or get information on the centroid and boundaries of the districts.

Two methods are available for working with bills:

`District Search`_
    Get list of districts for a state.
`District Boundary Lookup`_
    Get detailed geographical data for a single district.

These methods return district objects with the following fields.

District Fields
===============

All district methods return a subset of the following fields:

``name``
    Traditional name for the district, corresponds to the ``district`` field on associated legislators.
``chamber``
    'upper' or 'lower'
``abbr``
    abbreviation for the state/entity containing the district (corresponds to metadata ``abbreviation``)
``num_seats``
    number of seats in the legislature represented by this district (1 unless this is a multi-member seat)
``boundary_id``
    a unique ID used in `District Boundary Lookup`_ to get geographical details about the district
``legislators``
    (only returned for `District Search`_)
    a list of legislators serving in this district currently, consisting of:

    * ``leg_id`` - Open States Legislator ID
    * ``full_name`` - display name for the legislator

``shape``
    (only returned for `District Boundary Lookup`_)
    `GeoJSON <http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html>`_-style MultiPolygon coordinates array.

``region``
    (only returned for `District Boundary Lookup`_)
    Geographical extents of the boundary:

    * ``center_lon`` - Longitude of centroid.
    * ``center_lat`` - Latitude of centroid.
    * ``lon_delta`` - Range between max/min longitude.
    * ``lat_delta`` - Range between max/min latitude.

District Search
===============

Get a listing of all districts in a state (optionally just for a certain chamber).

URL formats
-----------

It is possible to lookup by state alone or by a combination of state and chamber:
